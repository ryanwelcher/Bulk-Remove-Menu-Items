Bulk Remove Menu Items
==============================
Select and remove many items at once from the built in WordPress menu system.

## Description

The custom menu system in WordPress is fantastic however the one thing you can't do is bulk remove items.
This plugin simply adds the ability to so.
Great for managing large menus or even for quickly clearing out a menu during development.

## Installation

Install this plugin as described in the[Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Installing_Plugins)

##Frequently Asked Questions

### Why did you make this plugin?

Because I am lazy and don't want to have to click remove on 10 items in the menu.

### Do you think I'm lazy too?

I don't NOT think you're lazy.

### What does that mean?

Nothing, I love you. Please download my plugin :)

### Why does it only select children of top level items?

That's a feature and certainly not a bug that will be addressed in upcoming versions of the plugin.
